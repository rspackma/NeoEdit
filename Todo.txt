Make modal dialogs modal for owning window only
Print
Add ability to select all attributes
Configuration shouldn't need transaction
Flag executes as being okay with parallel tabs (One at a time, .AsParallel() or .AsParallel().AsOrdered())
Less specific parsing (ignore method bodies, just line up {})
Split selections on line breaks to emulate removed "multi-line" function
Copy tabs active status so we can apply to another tabs window
Add content menu item to copy (and maybe others?) current tag, could handle nested
If tab created or deleted move recording/playing macro
Track pristine in undo history for large files
Modified should track by saving file, not transactional
Detect beginning/end of line from current position
If a key comes in multiple times handle them together, aggregate in macros too
Default binary checked when searching in binary view
Add option to copy command that would be in macro
Use PLinq to recreate TaskRunner?
Custom threading with actions, etc., like plinq but through taskrunner
Pass count to task runner so it doesn't use tolist
Make task runner run in command thread
Sort by expression
Can't select multiple tabs in grid view unless you click title
Add finalizers to check that all UI resources get deleted
Show which tab exception comes from
Calculate boolean expression from truth table
New content parsing - Handle nodes that contain other nodes
Draw nodes instead of selections if available
Nodes navigation - UpDown/LeftRight/ParentChild/Sequential
All content types should have a parent that includes entire document
Type qualify/unqualify all names (intellisense)
Make searchers accept NEText with index and length
Make each configuration return own type (maybe an interface with an object implementing several for duplicates)
Save maybe 10 levels of previous selections
Make everything use TaskRunner so we can see progress/cancel
Fix cursor in binary view
Different modes (content, text, etc.)
Eye tracking hardware for cursor
Only make menu appear when ready
If I delete the entire block a region is in delete the region
When pasting nothing whatever is selected should be deleted
Save as doesn't abort properly
Move Keys functions to dialog like Regions
Ctrl+S should save if only change is encoding
Expression dialog should be able to handle multiple selections like paste does
Text->Select->Whole Word doesn't seem to work in macros (it gets the start but not the end)
Add d+/- operator to add/subtract dates
Make Replace keep anchor for selections on undo
Make network->Adapters info open a new window and properly format table
When creating a new window make it match WindowLayout, ShowActive, and ContentType (maybe others?) of old window
Home should sync between tabs when deciding whether to move to first text or index 0
Find doesn't remember entire selection and remove at the same time
When summarizing large selections screen will be zoomed to the right even if first selection is small
Start recording/append macro shouldn't need to know which one
Copy from two files, nothing in one, many in other, then select all and paste. The file without data doesn't overwrite the selection
Make a new window blur in but not the content (or maybe glow)
In regions dialog use insert and delete to do things
In regions dialog instead of different functions for how to handle overlap (remove vs exclude) have an checkbox for overlaps
Check all expressions to make sure counts are handled properly (like in the move files dialog)
After universal undo is done remove any confirm options (like closing a window) except for exit
Add reset to all dialogs
If something pings NeoEdit when a dialog is up, cancel it
Make universal undo/redo in menu tell you what action they're going to undo
Break diff if one of the files moves to a different window
If file on disk is updated set modified flag
Add File->Select->By expression
