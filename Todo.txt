All:
Add command prompt
Add TFS source control
Visual Studio plug-in for integration

Disk:
Move timestamp (possibly others) from TextEditor
Select readable
Can't open any window if current directory is invalid (like when running off a network drive)
In active list add number of selections, allow sort, allow typing to find file

Text:
Files: Select/etc on svn status (ignore/modified)
Distinct operations by marked region (series/etc within region)
Select based on type (int, double, datetime, etc)
Submit forms
Go back to last selections
Change tab order when doc closed (match visual studio or something)
Time zones
Nest macros
~ in .cs confuses parser ([KeyGesture(Key.Down, ModifierKeys.Alt, commandSet: (int)~TextEditCommandSet.Content)] Diff_Next,)
Get DLL/EXE version info
Pull directory contents, including sizes/times (useful for diffing, others)
Copy positions/goto copied positions (useful for applying diff)
Refactor macro code
If user chooses rows and columns, scroll extra windows
Allow user to change zoom
Convert to columns based on text position (for non-delimited tables)
Alt+Up in diff only selects half of diff
Add ability to wait until program close (since inline diff tools wait for the program to exit; could remove -multi flag and share a diff window)
Only show file changed dialog when window is active and selected
Add multi-file status bar (shows how many (active? files|selections|etc.)
Improve sort performance for very large sets
Selecting the already selected file without shift down should deselect the other files
