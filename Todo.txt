Starting 2nd instance pops up in background

Search in multiple files

Text:
Bookmarks
Highlight clauses (if/else)
Text edit multiple files
Comment/uncomment C#/C++/XML/etc.
Format JSON/XML
Set line endings (\r\n / \n / \r)
HTML/XML: Match closing tag
Relative goto line/index should work for all selections
Ctrl+M should move to "current" selection
"Selection Mode": If any cursors have selections, treat non-selecting cursors differently: delete wouldn't delete the current character, it would do nothing.
Show number of items on clipboard on status bar
Continue after error deleting files (perhaps with dialog Yes/No/All)
Open more than one file at startup
Paste probably shouldn't work unless # selections is 1 (leave selections) or # copied

Set selection to what was redone/undone on redo/undo
Ctrl-Tab for tab navigation

Modifying binary value doesn't release cursor
Remember search history
Search with no results never returns
Backspace in middle of character deletes previous character instead
Add copy path/filename
Cursor hard to see
Fill selection (eg with 0s)
Checksum (and possibly others) should work only on selected text
Reload current file (perhaps automatically?)
Keep track of whether file is edited; object on close
Move open in text edit to File menu, rename from "Encode"
Move scrollbars/show values/status bar to canvas
Move FileTitle/FileName/Data/ShowValues/CoderUsed properties to only canvas
Rename windows to match TextEdit
